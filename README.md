# Twitter App Clone

In this project I followed along [Andy Leverenz‚Äôs brilliant Building a Twitter Clone screen casts](https://youtu.be/5gUysPm64a4) to build a light weight version of Twitter in other to get lot of healthy experience using Devise in the process.

I totally revamped the UI, modelling it to the current interface of Twitter instead of the 2017 version he was using in the video. I used bootstrap while he used Bulma, since I was alot familiar with bootstrap.

I also implemented the Flash messages using Toastr instead of the built in flash.


## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- Ruby
- Bootstrap
